# Nudgebee: Guided and Proactive Troubleshooting

## Introduction

In the first part of Nudgebee, I discussed how it helps with Day-2 Kubernetes operations. Now, let’s explore an essential aspect—troubleshooting. When issues arise, being able to quickly identify and fix them is critical to keeping systems running smoothly. Nudgebee simplifies and speeds up this process through its guided and proactive troubleshooting approach.

Kubernetes, while powerful, can be complex. When something breaks, figuring out the cause and resolving it can be difficult. As businesses increasingly rely on Kubernetes for managing their applications, a solid troubleshooting process is crucial. Nudgebee steps in with tools that make troubleshooting simpler and more efficient, helping teams stay ahead of potential problems.

## Why Effective Troubleshooting is Important

Kubernetes environments are complicated with many moving parts—whether it’s hardware, software, or networking layers. Problems can arise unexpectedly at any level, from pods to clusters. The dynamic nature of Kubernetes, while beneficial for scaling and managing workloads, can sometimes create unexpected challenges that disrupt services.

When an issue occurs, fast troubleshooting minimizes downtime. Prolonged outages can hurt customer satisfaction, reduce company revenue, and lower productivity. This is why a strong troubleshooting process is essential—not only to keep things running but to ensure that services remain reliable and efficient.

## How Nudgebee Improves Troubleshooting

Nudgebee significantly enhances troubleshooting in Kubernetes environments by making it faster and more effective. Here's how:

### View Only Critical Issues that Matter

Nudgebee helps you quickly view all critical issues, focusing on what truly needs attention. It filters alerts and highlights problems across every level—pod, node, cluster, application, namespace, and workload. This prevents teams from getting overwhelmed by less important issues, allowing them to focus on resolving critical incidents that impact performance the most.

### Guided, Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

Once an issue is identified, Nudgebee offers **smart, guided steps** to resolve it quickly. These step-by-step guides are tailored for each specific problem, making them highly useful even for team members with limited Kubernetes experience. The system skips the tedious root cause hunting, providing clear and actionable insights from the start. This saves time and helps resolve issues faster.

Nudgebee’s intelligence streamlines investigations by offering detailed insights, helping teams understand specific errors at each step. For example, teams can view **diffs of correlated deployments**, capturing any key changes that might have triggered the issue. Nudgebee also analyzes **pod events and logs**, helping pinpoint the root cause, while **escalating node-related events** to the operations team for further action.

You can look at the complete summary of the errors occuring in you kubernetes cluster along with different filters such as node and pod related errors.

### Real-Time Monitoring
At the core of Nudgebee’s optimization strategy is its real-time monitoring capability. This feature continuously tracks resource usage across the entire Kubernetes cluster. By doing this, Nudgebee can quickly identify when resources are being underutilized or stretched to their limits. For instance, if a particular pod is using significantly less CPU or memory than allocated, Nudgebee can adjust the resource limits to free up capacity for other workloads. 

This immediate insight allows for quick adjustments, ensuring that no resources go to waste and that there is always enough capacity to handle the workload. This real-time visibility not only improves efficiency but also reduces the risk of performance issues before they become critical.

You can also draw your desired decomposed namespace of the connected cluster using the Service Map feature of Nudgebee.

To check on the observability factor your cluster you can look for the traces, Nudgebee provides you to apply different filters while fetching the traces of your kubernetes cluster.
