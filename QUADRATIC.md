Data is the new fuel of the tech industry, and effectively storing, analyzing, and leveraging it is more important than ever. Analysts, data scientists, engineers, and developers work heavily with spreadsheets like Excel and Google Sheets for data analysis. However, as datasets grow and workflows become more complex, these traditional tools often set limits to analysts skills.

Managing large datasets, integrating code, and collaborating in real time often require complex setups with external tools. While AI and automation have transformed other areas of technology, spreadsheets have remained mostly untouched, lacking native support for programming languages, real-time collaboration, and seamless integrations.

## Common Challenges of Traditional Spreadsheets

Traditional spreadsheets present several challenges for users handling large or complex data sets:

1. **Limited Performance and Scalability**: Large data storage in traditional spreadsheets results in slow load times, and crashes become common.
2. **Lack of Programming Support**: Data stored in these spreadsheets typically require exporting to external tools for advanced analysis in Python, SQL, or JavaScript, disrupting workflow continuity.
3. **Limited AI and Automation Capabilities**: Most spreadsheets rely on basic formulas, offering little automation for complex tasks.
4. **Lack of Open Source Flexibility**: Traditional spreadsheet solutions are mostly closed source, limiting customization and extensibility.
5. **Inflexible Data Connectivity**: Connecting traditional spreadsheets to external databases, APIs, or third-party data sources is often complicated and requires additional tools.
