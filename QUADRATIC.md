I've always relied heavily on spreadsheets like Google Sheets for organizing data, analyzing results, and keeping projects on track. But over time, as the data grew larger and my projects became more complex, I started to notice limitations. Performance issues, lack of easy coding integrations, and problems collaborating with my team made me search for a better alternative.

## Why Traditional Spreadsheets Fell Short

- **Slow and Laggy Performance**: Large spreadsheets often slowed down or crashed, making it hard to work smoothly.
- **Missing Coding Features**: If I wanted to do anything advanced like use Python, SQL, or JavaScript, I had to export data and switch between tools constantly.
- **Basic Automation and AI**: The built-in automation was basic, and there was little support for modern AI integrations.
- **Difficult to Connect Data Sources**: Linking spreadsheets directly to databases or APIs was often complicated and required extra steps or tools.

## Discovering Quadratic: A Better Alternative

I recently spoke with David Kircos, the founder of [Quadratic](https://www.quadratichq.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kunal), a new browser-based spreadsheet that takes a different approach. Built using technologies like Rust, WASM, and WebGL, Quadratic is a new spreadsheet tool designed specifically to address these common pain points.
